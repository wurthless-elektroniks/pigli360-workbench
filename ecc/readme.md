Bad ideas need explanations, so let's go.

## "Glitch3" ECCs

These are RGH3-like images with a normal glitcher-based hacked SMC program.

Glitch3 was originally created with the assumption that some of the trial attacks kept crashing during
hardware init (POST 0x22, 0x23) because the memory/security units were too unstable coming out of the
reset glitch and needed a delay to stabilize. RGH3's CB_X provides such a delay so I tested it against
that to no success. The CPU kept crashing.

But it turns out CB_X can be very potent with the normal PLL and CPU_EXT_CLK attacks for a couple of reasons.

1. CB_X takes next to no time to load, so the glitch can run a lot sooner.
2. POST behavior during CB_X is fairly predictable. CB_X will output POST 0x54 when the payload has been
   moved to safe SRAM and it's delaying execution before loading CB_B. If the CPU crashes during a failed
   glitch attempt, it will usually do so at POST 0x54.

As such, this can speed up glitch attacks such that a boot can be attempted once per second.
For comparison, CR4 takes about 4 seconds to retry and SMC+ takes about two.

HOWEVER:

There is a good chance the CPU will still crash in CB_B at 0x2E (HWINIT). This is the typical behavior on
Jaspers. Therefore there is a chance that Glitch3 won't actually speed the boot up much in practice.

## "Reset Me" ECCs

These are SMC+ ECCs hacked to force a reset when DBG_LED is pulled high. They are infinitely useful for
systems that need rapid reset speedups during glitch attempts (hi Jasper owners).

I'm only building Glitch3 versions of these for now, as the whole point of Glitch3 is to speed up the boot
as much as possible. It's possible to use the same hacked SMC with Glitch2 but you gain little performance
advantage that way.
